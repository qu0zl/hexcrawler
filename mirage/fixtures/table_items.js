The bounty hunter is most likely only offering half of the real reward, but will not disclose the actual patron (which will be one of the reliquary-houses). Roll randomly to see if the characters are rescuing a Kshamarat or an Avarthamna. The captive will already have been taken into the tunnels outside of Izamne, so this will be a chase/tracking type of task in the side tunnels (see <b>Sidebox, Side-Tunnels &ltpg. 50&gt</b>'},
    {id:'RumourTable1_2', from:2, to:2, text:'Capture an escaped slave that is hiding somewhere in the city itself. This is most likely a slave of the darkfolk, although it could be a slave of the drow or duergar also. Capturing escaped slaves is considered a low form of work in Izamne, and if the characters get a reputation as slave-takers they will find that they are held more and more in contempt by potential employers. Most missions like this will be quite easy; it is just a matter of following the trail by asking questions. The dark creepers are aware of almost everything that happens in the city streets, and they will answer questions if the characters can show that they are working on behalf of a dark stalker (even of the other civilization). In a few cases, however, the escapee might have had the assistance of a more powerful creature such as a syanngg — either as an ally or as a kidnapper. These cases could turn ugly, and test the characters’ abilities more than the mere tracking of a fugitive.'},

If the monster is intelligent, it might have allies.
